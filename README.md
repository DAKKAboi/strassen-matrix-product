# strassen-matrix-product
This is an implementation of the Strassen Matrix Multiplication Algorithm in Python.
I am currently working through Introduction to algorithms by Cormen, i used the psedocode as a template for this program.
This algorithm multiplies two NxN matrices in O(N^ln[7]) time, which is faster than you would expect is possible.
